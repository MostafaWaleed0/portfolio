When I first started learning CSS, I quickly realized there was one thing I couldn’t do: **style a parent element based on what was inside it**.
If I wanted that, I had to use JavaScript or add extra classes manually.

Then I found the `:has` pseudo-class — and it felt like unlocking a hidden superpower.
Now CSS can actually _“look inside”_ an element and style it based on its children.

## Why It’s a Big Deal

With `:has`, you can style an element if it contains something specific inside it. For example:

```css
div:has(a) {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Every `<div>` with a link turns red. No scripting, no class juggling.

You can even target based on attributes:

```css
div:has(a[href^="https://"])
{
  color: pink;
}
```

Now you’re only styling `<div>` elements with secure links.

## Combining Powers

The fun starts when you mix it with other selectors. For example:

```css
div:not(:has(p)) {
  border: 1px solid pink;
}
```

That means “give a border to every div that doesn’t have a paragraph.”

Or get really specific:

```css
li:has(a + span) {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

That matches list items with a link immediately followed by a span.

## Styling by State

One of my favorite tricks:

```css
label:has(input:checked) {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

That’s all it takes to style a label when its checkbox is checked — no JavaScript listeners needed.

## My Take

`:has` feels like one of those CSS features we’ll look back on and wonder how we lived without. It keeps styling logic where it belongs — in the CSS — and removes a ton of messy DOM manipulation.

It’s not something I use every day, but when the problem calls for it, it’s elegant, declarative, and surprisingly powerful. If you haven’t played with it yet, spin up a CodePen and see what parent-aware CSS can do for you.
